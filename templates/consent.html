                    <p>You are invited to take part in a Brown University research study. Your participation is voluntary.
                    </p>
    
                    <p><b>RESEARCHER:</b> Michael Frank PhD; (401) 863-6871.</p>
    
                    <p><b>PURPOSE:</b> The research study is about examining your performance on a series of computerized
                        tasks as it related to learning and decision making. </p>
    
                    <p>In order to participate in this study, you must be healthy, between the ages of 18 and 40, and have
                        no medical history of brain injury, mental/psychiatric disorders or drug or alcohol abuse.</p>
    
                    <p><b>PROCEDURES:</b> You will be asked to complete a computerized task in which you will make decisions
                        on various stimuli depending on the instructions and memory requirements for the task. You may also
                        be asked to complete some brief questionnaires, which may ask for sensitive personal information,
                        such as specifics concerning your menstrual cycle. You are allowed to skip any questions which you
                        do not wish to answer.</p>
    
                    <p>It should be understood that there may be certain aspects of the study session which will not be
                        fully disclosed until after your participation is complete. Upon completion of the study session,
                        you will be given a full debriefing describing all research procedures and contact information by
                        the experimenter. Any questions you may have will also be addressed.</p>
    
                    <p><b>TIME INVOLVED:</b> The study will take from approximately 10 minutes to 1 hour of your time. You
                        will be notified of the duration of your participation prior to beginning.</p>
    
                    <p><b>COMPENSATION:</b> You will be compensated $0.11 per minute ($1.10 per 10 minutes) for your time.
                        Monetary compensation will be provided to you through your Amazon.com Mechanical Turk member
                        account. If your compensation will be based on performance, you will be notified prior to beginning
                        and given the option of abstaining participation.</p>
    
                    <p><b>RISKS:</b> There are no known risks to you for participating.</p>
    
                    <p><b>BENEFITS:</b> You may not directly benefit from being in this research study.</p>
    
                    <p><b>CONFIDENTIALITY:</b> Your records will be confidential. You will not be identified in any reports
                        or publications resulting from the study. It is possible that representatives of the sponsor that
                        supports the research study will want to come to Brown University to review your information.
                        Representatives of regulatory agencies (including the Brown University Human Research Protection
                        Program) may access your records. You may be asked for your Amazon.com Mechanical Turk username and
                        email address for the purpose of compensation through Mechanical Turk member services, however,
                        research personnel will not have access to your bank information at any time. All experiments
                        conducted online are hosted on a Brown University secure server. Your data, including responses to
                        questionnaires, will be maintained on a password-protected database on that server. Your email
                        address will be maintained in a location that is separate from the rest of your information. To
                        preserve confidentiality, you will be assigned a number and you will automatically be identified on
                        all forms by number only such that your name and data collected about you are not linked in any way.
                        Furthermore, any data stored on a computer will reference you only by this number. Only
                        investigators delegated to this study will have access to this data and none of this data will be
                        shared with third parties. In general, neither we nor anyone can absolutely guarantee the security
                        of data transmitted over the web. </p>
    
                    <p>This research is covered by a Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health.
                        The researchers with this Certificate may not disclose or use information, documents, or
                        biospecimens that may identify you in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative,
                        legislative, or other action, suit, or proceeding, or be used as evidence, for example, if there is
                        a court subpoena, unless you have consented for this use. Information, documents, or biospecimens
                        protected by this Certificate cannot be disclosed to anyone else who is not connected with the
                        research except, if there is a federal, state, or local law that requires disclosure (such as to
                        report child abuse or communicable diseases but not for federal, state, or local civil, criminal,
                        administrative, legislative, or other proceedings, see below); if you have consented to the
                        disclosure, including for your medical treatment; or if it is used for other scientific research, as
                        allowed by federal regulations protecting research subjects. Brown University staff sometimes review
                        studies like this one to make sure they are being done safely and correctly. If a review of this
                        study takes place, your records may be examined. The reviewers will protect your confidentiality.
